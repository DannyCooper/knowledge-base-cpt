In wp-admin, navigate to Settings -> Permalink Settings

Enter a value next to 'Knowledge Base'

Press 'Save Changes'.

= What does the 'Show only articles from current section?' setting do? =

If this option is enabled, the widget will only display articles within the same section as the current article or section being viewed.

This allows you to create a 'Related Articles' widget.
