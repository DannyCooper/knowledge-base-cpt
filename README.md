# [Knowledge Base CPT](https://wordpress.org/plugins/knowledge-base-cpt/) #

Enables a **knowledge base** post type and **section** taxonomy.

The plugin adds a Knowledge Base tab to your admin menu, which allows you to add articles just as you would regular posts. This allows you to keep your articles even if you change theme.
